# FirstGame
A turn-based game that pits the player against one enemy, in a total of 10 stages.
It is turn-based, and the objective in each stage is to defeat the enemy. Players have the options to Attack, use an HP Potion to recover HP or Guard.

In Version 1.5 I added dialogue for the player character and each enemy.

Version 2 is the first version to use classes instead of lists and dictionaries. This one does not use HP bars or implements dialogues

Future updates (V2 forward):

-Include HP bar

-Include other after-stage drops, such as an improvement to the HP potions

-The implementation of dialogue will be considered but most likely won't be executed. If it is, the dialogue from V1.5 will be used

Update logs:

-(jan. 15th 2018) added the game's V2 version, a simple "conversion" of using dictionaries and lists to using classes instead. No dialogue or HP bar were included in this version
