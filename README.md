# FirstGame
A turn-based game that pits the player against one enemy, in a total of 10 stages.
It is turn-based, and the objective in each stage is to defeat the enemy. Players have the options to Attack, use an HP Potion to recover HP or Guard.

In Version 1.5 I added dialogue for the player character and each enemy.

Future updates:
I am currently working on Version 2, which will use classes and objects now that I know how to work with them, an option for the player to quit the game at all times, and possibly "after-stage drops", which will increase player stats.
